# CatherineBmdExport
Tool for exporting dialogue from game Catherine for PC/PS3/PSV/PS4 etc.

The program could be better, but I don't have that much free time. 
The most important thing is that it works ;)

I worked out the file structure myself. The program works 100% with the PC, PSVita and PS4 versions. 
(The tool has been tested on them, but is very likely to work on X360 and the rest).

The import tool will be available soon ;)

It's already done but I need to add him support for Catherine Full Body (PSVita / PS4 ...)
